# Project1
First code Institute project

live website : danmcn.github.io/Project1/

My design was for 3 web pages. I wasn't sure about having an index.html page and a home page?
I decided to keep the index.html in a sparse way to just kick off the site.

I went to a few grinds websites but took my lead from firsttutors.com . Colors and headings I liked


I was trying to make the user experience as simple as possible so not too many moving parts just a structured layout with a common theme in the heading
for seamlessly switching between pages,

The colour scheme i picked was similiar to firsttutors.com green / white
I used the standard font scheme across all headers/body
font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;

For images I picked a standard size for every picture in the heading .

Languages used : HTML5 and CSS3

I wrote my code on visual studio on my PC . I didnt commit too often as i only knew I had to do this more often after talking with my tutor.
This will not be the case going forward .My commits will be more common.

I tested the website on google chrome , Brave, and on mobile phone.

Issues:
I tried to use the background picture feature  but i couldn't get it to work?
i was using the code below:
  background-image: url('assets/images/map.jpg');
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;

  on mobile phone the numbers in the ordered lists are not visible on the services page.
